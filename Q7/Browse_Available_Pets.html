    <b>Name of Animal:</b> Pepper
    <br>
    <b>Breed:</b> Maine Coon
    <br>
    <b>Gender:</b> Female
    <br>
    <b>Age:</b> 8 months
    <br>
    <b>Gets along with the following:</b> cats and dogs
    <br>
    <b>Description:</b> Sweet little Pepper is such a gentle soul. She loves to greet you with little kitty mews and chirps. Her favorite
    things include being petted, head scratches, playing with toys, and belly rubs. She likes to be around her
    people and at times can be your little shadow. She is very curious and likes to watch what you’re doing. She
    likes sleeping with her foster parents and loves to snuggle in the middle. Like humans, kitties have all kinds of
    unique personalities. Miss Pepper is a bit on the shy side at first. But, once you earn her trust, she will want
    your love all the time. She is better in a home with older children who won't chase or grab her. A big plus
    would also be a home with another kitty as she is very playful and would benefit from a trusty companion.
    Pepper is also good with dogs as her foster home includes two; a 40lb and 80lb. She really is a sweetie!

    <b>Name of Animal:</b> Mercury
    <br>
    <b>Breed:</b> Siberian
    <br>
    <b>Gender:</b> Female
    <br>
    <b>Age:</b> 10 years
    <br>
    <b>Gets along with the following:</b> some other cats
    <br>
    <b>Description:</b> Beautiful Mercury is ready to go! We responded to a plea on Facebook, a kind neighbor had noticed Mercury
    outside with an injured front leg. From what we understand, she was thrown out of her home during Covid.
    She's an old girl, estimated to be nearly 10 years old, so she must have had a very difficult time outside on her
    own. Her injury has healed but left some permanent damage. Mercury has a disability with her right front
    ankle/paw and needs to wear a soft brace on her ankle to protect it from wear. She accepts wearing it very
    well. Mercury is a very low-key, easy going cat looking for a good home and a little TLC. She is low
    maintenance, affectionate when petted, and enjoys hanging out with you on the couch watching a good movie,
    or even a bad one! Mercury has had it pretty rough, and it shows in her face. She deserves to live in a quiet
    home being a sweet companion to someone. She tolerates other cats but would do best as the only spoiled cat
    in the household.
